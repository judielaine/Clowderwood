## Notes on the plants

_Gladiolus_ are most likely a pink mid May, possibly a later season apricot/peach color, and there may be a few bulbs for plum colored blooms.

_Lindera benzoin_ (spicebush) Entangled with an azalea. I suppose i should just cut it back.

_Rudbeckia laciniata_ (cutleaf coneflower) Love the edible greens. Wish the deer would let the plants outside of fences plants get big. Happy to provide seeds by cutting off fruiting stems. 

_Smallanthus uvedalia_ (bear's foot) is an excellent pollinator and bird plant. Deer ignore it, but i have seen a couple fawns trying it out.  Happy to provide seeds by cutting off fruiting stems. I'm curious about the tuberous roots' edibility as are the folks at [Feralwood](https://ardealandproject.com/feralwood-shop/p/bears-foothairy-leafcup-seed) due to it's relationship with yacon.

_Verbesina occidentalis_ is an excellent late autumn pollinator and bird plant. Deer ignore it. Happy to provide seeds by cutting off fruiting stems. Most plants are at the edge of the "meadow" (septic field) and so need some care when digging out.

_Elephantopus tomentosus_ (elephant's foot) low growing, winter-dormant ground cover with panicles of purple flowers in late summer, fall. Excellent filler for dried flower arrangements. Wild on the property, now curated. Deer & rabbits ignore.
