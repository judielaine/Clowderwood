# Risk management

## Rainfall and flooding

Home is near the top of a ridge on a gentle slope. Berms have been installed that protect the west two thirds of the house and garage from sheeting water up slope, and plans are in the works for a swale or small pond plus berm to protect the eastern third.  Downspouts facing up hill have extenders and ditching (but more work could be done to continue ditching the southwest back porch downspout to east of the house). Downspouts concentrating rain just outside the kitchen window from main roof and garage have ditching to an under-drive pipe that routes water to a rain garden.

A 500 gal rain tank collects some of the water from the two back porch down spouts.

Flooding risk is minimal.

## Fire and heat

Only one non-native azalea and a non-native magnolia remain close to the house, which i suspect are more flammable than one would want. 

Landscaping near house includes: 

* Tulip poplars - NSCU doc LOW
* Persimmon - NSCU doc LOW
* Black walnut - Oregon State doc LOW
* Chestnuts - litter flamability higher than Chinese, [Ecosystems Vol. 22, No. 5 (August 2019), pp. 995-1006 (12 pages)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48701677), also [Ecosphere open journal](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3267)
* Sourwood - NSCU doc LOW
* Sweetgum - NSCU doc LOW
* Dogwood - NSCU doc LOW
* Redbud - NSCU doc LOW
* Pawpaw - NSCU doc LOW
* Serviceberry - NSCU doc LOW
* New Jersey tea - NSCU doc LOW
* Fig - @xenovandestra LOW
* Saucer magnolia - natives are LOW & MID
* Azalea - natives are MID

Surrounded by loblolly pines with NCSU doc HIGH rating.

  * Fig - "Reason for Fire Resistance: Fig fruit trees have large, lobed leaves that are less prone to burning."
  * Citrus - "Reason for Fire Resistance: Citrus trees have thick, waxy leaves with lower oil content, making them less susceptible to ignition."
* Chestnut? Elm, Tulip poplar
