# Over view of the front porch at Clowderwood

The gardens are described in the [front porch gardens overview](../../Gardens/Front%20porch/index.md)

## History

On our 2016 arrival, it looked like the front steps had been recently replaced with pressure treated wood steps. The treads were fairly narrow and, being on the north side of the house, they would stay slippery.

In late 2020 we replaced the wooden steps with [new stone steps](2020FrontSteps.md). Project essentially completed 2021-04-17.
