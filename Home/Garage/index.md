## Initial brief

We wish to retain an architect to provide initial cost, timing, and lumber estimates for a garage remodel and a yard tool outbuilding with a small greenhouse. The outbuilding project is required to house the tools currently in the garage. The garage project is both to provide additional living space but also to provide a wheelchair accessible entrance. There are risks to an ideal schedule driven by repair

For style notes, please consider [the work we had done on the front porch 2020-2021](../Front%20porch/2020FrontSteps.md). The mullions in the current windows will be removed when the windows are updated. The white trim of the windows and the front door is not preferred.

## Goals

The first engagement is so that we can (1) budget for an ideal build out execution and (2) have a clear vision of how project pieces interact with each other. Finally, (3) we have some harvestable pines on the property and want to maximize value from milling the pine for rough-cut lumber to use in the construction.

We're planning a project of two parts for our house outside of Pittsboro (within the Pittsboro planning area). One part is an out-building ("shed") that has a tiny greenhouse and room to store yard and garden equipment, the other is to convert the garage into space for creative work and storage, and for wheel chair access into the home. Because the garage conversion involves new windows, it is unclear if other window and door replacement and improvements should be considered at the same time for efficiency. That is, would doing window work X & Y at the same time save 50% over doing X and Y separately?

The shed should come first so the crowded garage can be unloaded.

* There must be storage for about eight mower and wheel barrow scale tools
* There must be storage for an array of hand tools
* There should be room for chemical storage and gas storage
* There should be room for fertilizers and other yard amendments
* There should be room for a large collection of plant pots from seed starting flats  
* It would be nice to have a potting bench area
* It would be nice to have a tiny greenhouse area (4" wide to the south)
  
I would want to consider a design to be low maintenance and maintainable, regionally appropriate, rustic, with a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Our current attitude towards the unfinished cedar siding on our home is that if we replace a few boards ever twenty years, that is preferred to repainting every ten. 

The garage work is to help create creative work space. 

* The interior is partly finished: some walls need sheetrock.
* The interior has random cabinetry in it: we expect that needs to be taken out.
* The wheel chair accessible entrance to the home needs to be accommodated

We would also like to make these changes over time, but we have a risk that the current garage door will fail.  If it fails before we have the shed, is there partial work towards the long term plan to enclose that can be done that will not make the other work harder?

Deliverables

1. detailed layout and designs for shed
2. rough layout and designs for garage conversion
3. consult on green wood cuts from pine with forester contact
4. consults on windows for the garage and how to stage that with addressing the current windows in the house 
5. suggestion on budgets



 ## Garage conversion ideas

 The garage opens to the north, so the desire is to enlarge the garage door opening and have windows to illuminate the space with north/indirect light. Also,  the house is on a grade, and the floor of the house is more than three feet above the garage floor. Planning for aging, any ramp for house access will be problematic to install. I think better access  would be a wheelchair lift. The current door from kitchen to garage would not work for a wheel chair, so we are interested in investigating whether a door can be added to the load bearing wall between the kitchen and the garage, and open to a platform (and steps) where a lift could be added in the future. Under the platform could be storage space for the archives we have and
