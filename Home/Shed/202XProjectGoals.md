## Shed site

The shed can be open and face the south, which is a fairly open area (the drain field aka meadow). We can  accommodate a 30' x 20' footprint. There is a slight slope to the south of about one foot of fall for every eight feet. The soil is a red clay.

The site will be very visible from the large windows of the refurbished garage, so a half wall, perhaps of lattice or metal roofing might help reduce some visual clutter.

 TODO verify slope

 ## Shed ideas

 I have imagined a long open building, with gables at the east and west ends. The north side faces the woods between us and the road, and is visible driving up. That would be a solid wall -- standing seam metal roofing? COR-TEN-like standing seam? Cedar siding like the house? The east end faces the drive and could be more creatively finished from the same materials.

 The south side i originally imagined wide open, but realized it is the view from the garage and so revised to imagine it as perhaps with a half wall. I know an open structure will invite Carolina wrens and muddauber wasps.

 I imagine tiny greenhouse on the west end scaled in units of sheets of translucent corrugated roofing. I have imagined rain water collection from the roof could be stored in a stack of IBC tanks and act as a heat reservoir for the greenhouse. I am imagining that the greenhouse could act mostly as a season extender as i assume external heat sources would be needed to keep it above freezing during some of our cold snaps.
