Ice plants like to be very dry throughout the winter. Cut back on watering starting in late fall. If you get snow or hard frost in the winter, don’t water them at all. The leaves might shrink a little from lack of moisture, but that’s preferable to freezing from the inside out! 
Ice plant, like most succulents, doesn’t care much for humidity. Too much is an invitation to pest infestations and rot. Make sure that your ice plant is placed somewhere dry and pruned to allow good air circulation in the foliage.

""The E. capillifolium oil showed promising repellent activity against the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, whereas the oil exhibited moderate activity against the mosquito's first instar larvae in a high throughput bioassay. Topical applications of the oil showed no activity against the blood-feeding female adults of A. aegypti. Eupatorium capillifolium essential oil showed a linear dose response between adult lace bug (Stephanitis pyrioides) mortality and increasing oil concentration in an adulticidal activity bioassay. The dog-fennel oil was more potent than the conventional insecticide malathion. In conclusion, these combined results showed Eupatorium capillifolium oil is a promising novel source of a biological insecticide with multiple modes of action.” — https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA529290 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1/16/2022 1:55pm,,,,

Insects are not usually a big problem with stevia, though some larger animals like rabbit and deer can be attracted by the sweet taste of the leaves. Aphids will sometimes feed on stevia, but very few insects are partial to the sweet leaves. - How to Grow Stevia | Backyard Gardening Blog

Propagation from seed is a snap, and happily, the red-stemmed cultivar of Malabar spinach comes true from seed. Saving seed is easy too: Simply dry the entire fruit and use it for planting the following year. Stem and tip cuttings may be employed as well.
 Red Malabar Spinach
Heat loving salad and stir-fry green. - Vigorous climbing vines grow through summer into fall. Glossy, thick, savoyed leaves resemble spinach. Dark green leaves and deep red/purple stems. Mild Swiss chard taste. Use leaves and young stems sparingly in salads or stir-fries. Avg. 16,500 seeds/lb. Packet: 100 seeds.

Malabar spinach does best in a slightly acidic, moist, fertile soil, though it can tolerate poor soil conditions. Stem tip cuttings may be rooted, overwintered inside, and transplanted out again the following year or kept as a houseplant. Provide trellis support.

The bedrock of this project was provided by two historic perennial tree kales that seldom flower, ‘Purple Tree Collards’ and ‘Daubenton’. The story is complicated, but these kales were crossed to each other and other Pacific Northwest & West Coast perennial kales as well as a variety of other Brassica oleracea including Baltic Red Kale, Brassica oleracea montana, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, Red Cavalier Kale, savoy cabbage, Spis Bladene, Walking Stick Kale, and more. Their progeny have been inter-crossed, reselected, cloned, isolated, reselected, interbred — many times now since 2011. This process forms a grex. What is a ‘grex’ you may ask? Grex in Latin means ‘flock’ and originally comes from the orchid hybridization world. It essentially means a genetically diverse interbreeding mix. An apt moniker for seed stewardship generally, as we are shepherds who herd seeds forward into the world. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,5/5/2024 5:24pm,,,,

These hybrids are noted for having attractive green foliage (often flushed with red, purple or bronze), attractive flowers (shades of lavender, pink or red) and a long summer bloom period (July to September). Plants typically grow to 2 1/2' tall. Narrow-ovate leaves appear in a basal rosette in spring. Flower stems rise from the rosettes in July bearing showy, terminal, bracteate spikes of tubular flowers. Each flower (1-2"" long) has two lips, with the three lobes of the lower lip appearing more prominent than the two lobes of the upper lip. The flowers are highly attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds.

STARSHIP SCARLET was introduced by Kieft Seeds at its 2014 Spring Trials. It has numerous stems of bright scarlet red flowers and bronze green foliage.

NCSU says: Walter's Viburnum is a SE USA native large shrub or small tree that is densely twiggy and upright ascending. it is not native to NC but could easily grow in southern Piedmont and coastal areas of the state. It is evergreen to semi-evergreen with a dense rounded form. Its native habitat is the coastal plains in hammocks, thickets, and swamp margins. This plant is slightly salt tolerant. Even though its native range is zones 8-9, it will grow in zones 7-10.
The small leaves add varying amounts of purple color in fall and remain semi-evergreen to evergreen in warm winter climates. Tiny, white, 5-petaled flowers in dome-shaped clusters bloom in early spring. Oval blue-black fruits follow and mature in fall.

Varietal Characteristics: …. We thought it was a Charleston Scarlet, when in fact it was an all purple variety simply called Scarlet. We cannot find published data on this variety, so we are relying on grower feedback from last year and will collect additional feedback this year. 
Grower Feedback: Keep in mind that our grower feedback was somewhat tainted given that growers bought these slips thinking they were going to harvest an orange sweet potato, not a purple one.   Having said that, results in appearance, flavor, and yield were completely across the board with low to high ratings. Overall, from the feedback, you should expect a lower yield from this variety than the production potatoes like Covingtons. One gardener said, ""impressed with the taste and will increase amount of them next year,"" while another said, ""The purple sweets did not produce at all. Won't get them again."" (Hmmm... see why this is so hard for us?)

20171202 OIKOS Tree Crops order 4 tubers to fight stilt grass 
Grown From Seed -Fertile Flowers - Edible Peas
Virginia is a mix of diploid selections  which then produces edible seeds as well as tubers when pollinated by another fertile diploid. We include at least 2 types in each packet of tubers. We were fortunate to grow this strain from seed that are known to be diploids which produce the pea pods and tasty peas along with good tuber production. Most of them come from Afton, Virginia.  Each plant is genetically different with different types of tubers from small to medium size. We have made some selections with this seed strain and have found the tubers are in often in dense clusters along the root, making harvesting easier.  Tubers are 1- 2 inches in size and have a smooth thin skin. Keep in mind the tubers on Virginia  are much smaller than the other selections we have, yet are very fruitful and high yielding. It is possible some selections will be produced much like potatoes in more dense clusters making harvesting much easier. That was our goal when we started growing the seedlings. Available starting in fall of 2017.",,"http://www.namethatplant.net/plantdetail.shtml?plant=108

The flowers are edible raw or cooked and the seeds are edible cooked, shelled first. Some writers say the tubers are edible raw but that only tells me they never tried to eat one raw, or coped with the gas that produces. Groundnuts have a bitter latex in them and should be cooked first…. . I enjoying slicing up boiled A. americana and frying them — http://www.eattheweeds.com/groundnuts-anti-cancer-treat/

Tubers are planted intact. The buds that give rise to the shoots and rhizomes occur at the distal end of the tubers. The potential of dividing tubers into sections prior to planting needs evaluation. Generally the larger the tuber, the more rapid the early growth

Seeds may be harvested from the time the pods first begin to dry. If left on the vine too long some pods will shatter Tubers are harvested after frost. Since most of the plants are different (originating from seeds), the tubers are harvested with a shovel to insure that genotypes can be evaluated individually. Fortunately, tubers can remain in the soil for extended periods without rotting even under water-logged conditions, thus allowing an extended harvest period.— From ""Purdue’s new crop proceedings of 1990"" per

If you are planting saffron as an annual, you can plant each bulb on 4-inch centers.

The nectar of this aromatic perennial, a member of the mint family, is attractive to bees and hummingbirds. The Oswego Indians in New York used the leaves for tea, giving this culinary herb its nickname: Oswego tea. Related to the bergamot used in Earl Grey Tea (same family but different genus), bee balm's blooms are strongly flavored and best used sparingly. Separate the petals from the main head to scatter over fruit salad, or steep the flower heads in liquid, then strain for a refreshing sorbet or jam.

From quite a distance you can see a cloud of butterflies and bees hovering over our planting which is located in the middle of a field of quack grass. The mint foliage is just divine and makes a dark rich tea. Kind of a light mix between licorice and peppermint. Not quite as vigorous as the cultivated mints but does spread by runners in dense clusters or groups. In 25 years ours has spread 15 ft. out from the center but it is not a single colony excluding other plants. Native prairie species used for headache and colds.

 "" All of these clones have foliage that is dormant or semi-dormant, and all have proved fully hardy.
...
The clones 'Jennie Love' and 'Charmaine Queen' are selections of numerous seedlings of several generations derived from wild plants of Hemerocallis fulva var. rosea of which the 'Rosalind' clone is the type plant. A seedling of one of the early generations was named 'Charmaine' in 1934.
The 'Jennie Love' daylily is dedicated to the memory of the writer’s sister-in-law. The flowers have spreading and somewhat twisted petals and recurving and twisted sepals as shown in figure 6 and the spread is about five inches. The mid-zone of the petals is bright red bisected by extensions of the golden throat. The general aspect of the flowers is a bright reddish pink, due to the scarlet-red veins that extend into the otherwise pink blades. The scapes are well branched and erect to a height of thirty-six to forty inches. ""
( cited from: The Garden Journal, 1956, vol. 6, p. 9-11 )
The 'Charmaine Queen' daylily has long petals and sepals that give a spread of as much as six inches. The ground color of the petals is coral-pink with a bright red mid-zone and veins. The sepals are more uniformely coral-pink, for the veins are not as conspicuous as is the general rule. The scapes have been as much as forty-five inches in height. The flowering period of these two clones has been in July. ""

Asparagus officinalis (asparagus),Less interesting,0,,Species,Asparagus officinalis (asparagus),Liliaceae: Asparagus officinalis (asparagus),species,,,,,,,edible,,2021 avoid until weed pressure easier.,,"s the driveway island the best place for asparagus? (Morning and full sun?). what about Garden planning: Asparagus Bed upslope from rain garden 

ASPARAGUS needn’t have it’s own patch. The crowns prefer wide spacing, which offers the opportunity to interplant quick growing early spring edibles like radish, beets and greens. Think of this as a miniature form of alley cropping (a technique where farms can slowly transition from annual production to perennial by sowing annual rows between tree crop rows until the trees grow to fill the space). Later in the season asparagus benefits from tomato and basil companionship, which will ward off asparagus beetles. Asparagus in turn can deter nematodes. - https://sowtrueseed.com/blogs/gardening/incorporating-perennials-into-your-annual-garden-or-working-towards-utopia

Ten crowns will fit in a 4-by-8-foot bed and are generally enough to supply a family of four. Try to time your purchase so the asparagus crowns can go in the ground without delay. If you have to store the crowns for more than a day or two, place them in a bucket of moist sand in a basement or other cool environment until you are ready to plant. -- http://modernfarmer.com/2015/04/how-to-plant-asparagus/

Asparagus needs well-drained soil and at least eight hours of sunlight per day. Asparagus will grow in dappled shade. https://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-asparagus-shade-32239.html

The recommended amount of sunlight to grow asparagus is 7 to 8 hours a day. Morning sunlight will be essential and 6 hours should be considered a minimum. … consider planting your asparagus as a border plant. You will only be harvesting the choicest spears, allowing the remainder to mature and develop the ferny headpiece that is critical to energizing the crowns for next year's harvest. http://blog.gardenharvestsupply.com/2011/12/19/just-about-everything-about-asparagus-2/

EFN INTRODUCTION. Musk Mallow is a super nutritious, easy to grow, versatile perennial leaf crop – maybe the closest thing we have to a perennial lettuce substitute. The flowers (in bloom from spring to fall!) are also edible, and quite beautiful too. Bees and other beneficial insects love it. The leaves are rather fascinating in form too: the first ones, which become the lowest leaves on the plant, are round and resemble other mallow leaves, but they gradually morph as the plant grows, and eventually the upper leaves look nothing like the lower leaves. They much more resemble certain geranium leaves (and, come to think of it, the flowers resemble some geranium flowers too). Both the slightly mucilaginous leaves and flowers are eaten raw or cooked, and the seeds are edible too. The plant also has a long history of medicinal use, said to be useful against inflammation, insect bites, bruises, fevers, and urinary and digestive issues. It can be used as an expectorant and a laxative as well. Native to Eurasia, it has become quite common here and has naturalized in other temperate climates around the world. 
The seeds we're selling come from EFN co-founder Nate Kleinman's farm in Chenango County, New York, on the side of Tinker Ridge. Very pretty volunteers, some sporting pink flowers, others white, showed up in a few spots on freshly tilled ground in 2020. The species appears nowhere else in the area, so we can only assume the seeds were sitting in the weed bank underground for years – likely many decades – waiting to burst forth once the lawn was ripped up. The seeds are apparently incredibly hardy: one company selling them offers 22-year-old seed right now with a recent germination test of 99%! Pretty mind-boggling.

Productive and easy to grow. Bears delicious medium-size figs. Exhibits drought-tolerance once established. May die back in colder climates and resume growth in spring. Bears fruit early on new growth. Fruit produced on the older wood will appear in early summer and fruit on new growth will appear in early fall. Ripe fruit has a dark mahogany color. Originates from Sicily. Grows well in containers! Heat-tolerant. Ripens in July through frost. Self-pollinating.

Savor sweet, dark mahogany fruit with rich red flesh with the . Hardy Chicago Fig Tree. It is indigenous to Sicily, where the variety is known to have been growing at about 3000 feet above sea level where it gets quite cold. It gained a reputation in Chicago where cuttings somehow made their way to the U.S. with the help of an Italian gardener. The tree flourishes despite the harsh winters. Perhaps the coldest hardy fig ever discovered they will yield large amounts of fruit in the garden or dwarfed in containers. And it is fast growing too! In many instances it can produce fruit first year; by second year fruit will appear on old growth in early summer and then in the fall fruit will begin to appear on new growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,8/22/2021 7:27pm,,,,

Transplant (recommended): Sow seed on soil surface and press into soil or cover lightly, as light aids germination. Moisten lightly and cover with a dome lid or other cover to conserve moisture. If available, use bottom heat to enhance germination. Keep soil temperature at around 68°F (20°C) until germination, or 68°F (20°C) at night and 86°F (30°C) during the day. Do not over-water. Transplant clumps into larger cells and grow in a warm place until after the last chance of frost has passed. When the minimum soil temperature is 45°F (7°C), transplant 3-4"" tall seedlings in clumps or as individual plants outdoors. Space 8-12"" apart in rows that are 18"" apart. Keep moist and well weeded. Lemon grass doesn't tolerate frost. Rarely flowers as an annual. Can be dug an divided in the fall to pot up for overwintering indoors or start new plants each spring. — http://www.johnnyseeds.com/herbs/lemon-grass/lemon-grass-east-indian-cleaned-seed-lemon-grass-seed-4074.html

The dark green, glossy foliage is mildew and disease resistant, an improvement on older varieties of Phlox that don’t hold up as well in the heat and humidity of summer. Plant these in an area with good air circulation and plenty of sunshine for the best performance. With a stoloniferous growth habit, this Phlox will spread slowly over the years.

Another common sorrel is ‘Profusion,’ an unusual patented variety that mutated naturally in France to produce plants that never run to seed, always have fresh, ready-to-pick leaves, and have no known natural enemies aside from deer, rabbits, chickens and goats. The leaves are round, dark green and more succulent than most other common sorrels. It can be eaten raw in salads or cooked like other greens. This gourmet sorrel was introduced commercially in 1993 by Richter’s and is still available from them. ‘Profusion’ sorrel can be increased only by division or cuttings. It makes a great ornamental border plant because it grows in compact mounds of 8 to 10 inches.

Aquilegia canadensis, Columbine, also called Red or American Columbine, is one of the first plants to provide nectar in the spring for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. The colorful flowers are red flowing into yellow.  Besides being an early bloomer, Columbine will tolerate a large range of soil and sun types, so you'll have success with it in full sun as well as shade.  It can grow in pine tree areas and is deer-resistant.  The seeds of Aquilegia are shiny black pearls and can be easily collected and planted.

From https://www.ecolandscaping.org/05/native-plants/high-impact-native-american-shrubs/ 
New Jersey Tea (Ceonanthus americanus) is a beautiful small shrub with fragrant white flowers, somewhat resembling a spirea. The yellow stems are noticeable in the winter. Like many other shrubs in the buckthorn family it is able to fix nitrogen from the air (with the help of symbiotic microorganisms), allowing it to thrive in extremely poor soils. Therefore, New Jersey Tea is an excellent choice for dry, rocky slopes and other difficult locations with lean soil.

The merits of Ceonanthus americanus are becoming popular in pollinator gardens. Photo: John Oyston [Attached]

The root system is fibrous on the surface, but has some strong tap roots that reach deep into the soil, which is why this shrub is difficult to transplant and therefore not very common in the trade. Due to a considerable rise in demand, it has become more widely available in the last few years. Research has proven that an inoculation with the nitrogen-fixing organisms (with the tentative name Streptomyces ceanothi) will increase growth of this plant and could be used to enrich poor soil, such as in re-vegetation areas; however, a practical method to achieve this has not yet been developed.
New Jersey Tea is a useful native shrub for pollinator gardens. The slightly fragrant flowers attract hummingbirds and a wide range of pollinating insects. It is a host plant for caterpillars of various butterflies, including azure (Celastrina) and duskywing species (Erynnis martialis and others). Unfortunately, deer also have a taste for it, therefore it is useless to plant it where deer populations have fallen out of balance and turned into pests. And, because deer are overpopulated almost everywhere, they have contributed to the disappearance for a considerable number of native plants!

I was scouting for Chickasaw plum seed when I noticed a single old plum tree with a few large, attractive fruit that were also tasty. The old tree had more dead than live branches and no growth suitable for rooting but I felt the plant was worthy of preserving. I made a single hack with a machete on the back of the tree to induce sprouting. Upon my return the following summer there was a nice healthy sprout that resulted in three rooted specimens that were outplanted in my fruit orchard. These three plants were the source of cuttings for the propagation of Guthrie plum. The name Guthrie was chosen because a Guthrie family was the nearest resident to the old tree. These three trees plus several more continue as our source of cuttings. I hope this information will serve your needs. I look forward to seeing your selection with purple leaves.

Hi there,

I'm looking for a treeform Amelanchier for our driveway island. It will be full sun in North Carolina red clay 30' east from the trunk of a young black walnut with a clear southern exposure. It seems Amelanchier spp do well with black walnuts. I'm hoping for the (random seedling) black walnut to fill out and become a lovely shade tree, so it may eventually over shadow the Amelanchier spp.

I'm also interested in Amelanchier sp that would act as an ecosystem replacement for the autumn olive (Eleagnus umbellata) that thrive under our 90' yellow pines.

I'd appreciate your thoughts about which of your Amelanchier varieties might do well for both purposes. My climate and soil notes are below.

With thanks,
judith bush

Amelanchier is tricky because it is 'latitude' sensitive and most of ours are very good in Michigan but may not work farther south because of issues with disease. The disease is more of an issue with the fruit quality and growth rate of the plant too. The variety success we grow is probably the most southern we have that would grow in your area.

As far as autumn olive goes-there really isn't a native substitute in that the high nutrition of the seeds and fruit pulp and ripening period including flower nectar production for native insects made it a very unique plant with a very positive effect in the environment. Maybe other red berried plants like Viburnum or Coralberry might be somewhat at the same time in terms of ripening. I would try that if you do not want Autumn olive. (It appears after reading on line no one wants it! 

Thanks for your interest.

TODO, when blooms  https://davesgarden.com/community/forums/t/1495843/ 

Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occientalis) is quite commonly found along the edges of ponds and rivers, and according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the USDA, it is an obligate wetland shrub suitable for use in wetland restoration, created wetlands, and erosion control in riparian zones. In the garden it can adapt to regular soil, but is most useful for areas with poor drainage. Note that it is reported to be less floriferous in dryer conditions.
The spherical white flowers are the major asset of this shrub. Besides the ornamental use buttonbush is a valuable wildlife plant. The flowers providing nectar for hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, and other insects, and it is a good source of nectar for honeybees as well. It is also a food plant for caterpillars of two Sphinx moths [Hydrangea Sphinx (Darapsa versicolor) and the Titan Sphinx (Aellopos titan)]. The seeds are consumed by eight species of water fowl, and wood ducks use the shrub for nest sites. The twigs are consumed by various mammals, unfortunately including white-tailed deer. — https://www.ecolandscaping.org/05/native-plants/high-impact-native-american-shrubs/",,Cephalanthus occidentalis (button bush)@CFH2021MM,,,,,,,,,,,9/5/2021 1:06pm,,,,

In the wild this plant appears a bit unkempt and despite the interesting flowers has not found its way into mainstream gardening. A variety with increased vigor (‘Keystone’) has been selected for wetland applications, but for ordinary garden use, one of the major drawbacks of buttonbush is its size, reaching a height of 12 feet in the wild. However the demand for this shrub might increase in the future since a new and considerably more compact variety, ‘Sugar Shack® Buttonbush’ (Cephalanthus occidentalis ‘SMCOSS’) has been released. ‘Sugar Shack’ is also noted for its glossy foliage and reddish fruit. This refined version would be well-suited for smaller home gardens and pollinator gardens, especially where there is abundant water. Sugar Shack is offered by Proven Winners with the claim, “We’ve cut the size in half and added colorful red fruit and glossy foliage.” It might be an excellent choice for rain gardens. — https://www.ecolandscaping.org/05/native-plants/high-impact-native-american-shrubs/",,,,,,,,,,,,,5/5/2024 5:31pm,,,,

""We're thrilled to be offering these seeds for the first time. Our friend Andy Hahn collected these ground cherries from unirrigated sites in the Denver area, where annual precipitation averages only about 15 inches. The plants form a deep perennial rhizome. Fruits are pea- to marble-sized, and range from green to yellow. Andy describes the taste as ""sweet and tasty,"" similar to the common annual varieties of ground cherry, but these are all from perennial plants. He believes the species is Physalis virginiana, but there may also be some Physalis longifolia and/or hybrids in the mix. Most of the plants were just 6 to 8 inches tall, but loaded with fruit.

Nuccio's Gem Camellia - Camellia japonica 'Nuccio's Gem’ via Monrovia 
Sparkling white, formal, double blooms contrast well with the glossy, dark green foliage. This mid-season bloomer is a prized plant of the milder regions of the U.S. Evergreen.

Nuccio's Pearl Camellia Camellia japonica 'Nuccio's Pearl’ via Monrovia 
 Spectacular, fully double blooms with pure white petals edged with an orchid pink blush. Flowers make a dazzling contrast against the glossy, dark green foliage. Adds an elegant, formal appearance to any garden. A mid-season bloomer. Evergreen.

The Nuccios have introduced more than a hundred new camellia varieties, including such classics as 'Nuccios' Gem' and 'Nuccio's Pearl' but have never patented one. [before 'Nuccio's Bella Rossa’] - http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/11/news/cl-10873",,,,,,,,,,,,,9/25/2021 7:58pm,,,,

Homestead purple verbena,Interesting,0,,Hybrid,Verbena 'Homestead Purple',Verbenaceae: Verbena spp and Glandularia spp,no patent,,,,,,NC - Hybrid,"ground cover,naturalizing",,,," Homestead Purple is listed as a cultivar of Verbena canadensis, which grows wild throughout the southeast, including all of Arkansas, and ranges as far north as Zone 5 in Iowa. The species is a perennial, but a temperamental one that is very particular about its exposure and drainage, especially during the winter.
In all probability, Homestead Purple is a chance hybrid with another verbena species because its identifying characteristics and vigor are not characteristic of the straight species.
The discovery of the plant is due to the keen eyes of two University of Georgia horticulture professors, Alan Armitage and Mike Dirr. Armitage is one of the nation's foremost authorities on perennial plants, while Dirr is the undisputed woody plant guru.
The two were returning to Athens, Ga., when they drove past a purple mass of flowers neither recognized. They did a U-turn and asked the lady who lived on the homestead about the plant. She didn't know much about it apparently it had been growing there for years. They collected cuttings and the plant went on to fame and glory. -- https://www.northcreeknurseries.com/plantName/Verbena--Homestead-Purple",,,,,,,,,,,,,5/5/2024 5:31pm,,,,

Curcuma longa (tumeric),Interesting,0,,Species,Curcuma longa,Zingiberaceae: various culinary gingers,species,,,,,,Asia,,,,,"From Plant Delights: Curcuma longa emerges during the monsoon season and are triggered to become dormant by dry weather. This roughly corresponds to the winter/summer cycle in temperate gardens....  If you let your Curcuma get too dry, they will lose their leaves and stop flowering. Moist, but well-drained, organically-rich, slightly acidic soils produce the best flowering. Curcuma longa prefers sun for at least a couple of hours, but most species will also do fine in high, open shade.We have also found that Curcuma will perform best if lifted and divided every 5 years in order to maintain their vigor. In doing so, keep in mind that if you divide the plants when they are too small, they may not flower for a couple of years. At a minimum, leave 3-5 eyes (the creamy pointy things) per division, but more is better. Dividing is best done in spring or summer. When re-planting, place the rhizomes 4-6"" below the surface to give them some cold protection, although the rhizomes will eventually grow to the depth that best suits them.... Curcuma are not bothered by many pests, with slugs and snails being the worst…especially on the unfurling leaves.

Curcuma longa (Turmeric) (syn. Curcuma domestica) is one of the toughest Curcuma that we grow. The 3' tall pleated green leaves of Curcuma longa are adorned, starting in early September, with colorful pinecone-like flowers that are nestled among the leaves.
