They might be too close, and the Wisconsin to the south might shade Thomas Edison. Can move these guys next year.

Added compost, scraped away  weeds (mainly stilt grass). Planted the two daylily fans at the base of somecutleaf coneflower, mulched with  cutleaf coneflower. 

Another strawberry harvest.

Three kwanzo fans, look great.

Six solomon seal, still spindly. Probably need the soil enriched.

Four clumps spiderlilly from Laura look great. The flowers seem more purple than some of the others i have. 

Choosing to label the first gamecock to bloom as 240. First bloom!

    - Matteuccia struthiopteris 'The King'
    - The King Ostrich Fern
    - (aka: Matteuccia 'Fanfare') Matteuccia 'The King' is an amazing selection of ostrich fern, distributed by Larry Mellichamp, who got it from NC's Powell's Garden around 1985. Matteuccia 'The King' is one of the few forms we've found that thrives in the hot, humid southeastern US, where normal ostrich ferns fear to tread. The 3' tall deciduous rosettes (6' tall under ideal conditions) spread vigorously via underground rhizomes. In nature, the deer-resistant ostrich ferns are found in moist ditches and lowlands, but also adapt well to drier garden conditions where they grow a bit shorter. Patches of Matteuccia struthiopteris 'The King' are highlighted by the 18"""" brown fertile fronds that appear in fall and persist through the winter

    - Ellisiana Spineless Prickly Pear
    - planted + 2022-05-15 near compost in NW corner with four elephants foot from N border, E section
    - near current compost (also add elephant's foot)
    - Our plant is a spineless selection of the US/Mexican native Opuntia cacanapa named 'Ellisiana'. For us, this fast-growing but compact opuntia makes a 3' tall x 6' wide deer-resistant mound (in 5 years) of 6"""" grey-green spineless pads. In August, the clump is topped with large, bright yellow flowers...a hummingbird oasis, followed by large red """"pears."""" Well-drained winter soils are vital for best performance.

    - Asclepias incarnata 'Cinderella'
    - planted + 2022-05-15 rain garden, NE quadrant
    - Cinderella's Pink Swamp Milkweed
    - Asclepias incarnata forms stunning 50"""" tall stalks, topped in summer with branched terminal heads of mauvy-pink flowers, attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies. Asclepias incarnata prefers moist-to-soggy soils but fares well in typical garden soils...barring extended droughts. A regular renaissance plant, Asclepias incarnata stays fresh in a vase as well as being a monarch butterfly indulgence.

    - Little Redhead Indian Pink 
    - S berm
    - We received this compact form of the wonderful North American native Indian pink from plantsman and garden writer Pam Harper, who extolled its virtues after many years in her garden. Pam originally got the plant years earlier from Bob McCartney of Woodlanders Nursery. While all Spigelia marilandica are great plants, Spigelia 'Little Redhead' is more compact, topping out at 21"""" tall. The stalks are topped from mid-May until mid-July (NC) with stunning, dark blood-red, tubular flowers highlighted with yellow inside...a hummingbird delight.

20211107-Wishlist,2021-11-07,,,,Wishlist,"Good pecan score, $50 
Vendor doesn't have best pecans for home. But would be far cheaper. 5gal trees $25 each.

Dear Lakeview Pecans,

 I'm interested in buying a pair of pecans from you. 

 I live in Pittsboro, NC, pretty much an hour's drive west of you. In Pittsboro proper, pecans are shade trees along the streets and there is nutfall. I expect that i could have some success. However, the cleared area on my 4 acre lot is surrounded by 90' loblolly pines. Given various constraints the north east corner of the cleared area is about 40' x 40' and is my best site for a pecan tree -- it's probably the best site for light on the lot altogether. There is room to the west for a tree, but it would have other trees to its east and west - -fine southern exposure. This location is within 100' of the prime location. I assume this site is ok for a pollinator for the tree in the prime location, although not itself a great location for production.

 After hours of consulting the NCSU extension page and the University of Georgia's list of varieties recommended for home or low input growth (https://pecanbreeding.uga.edu/cultivars/recommended-list.html), it seems that i would want significant scab resistance.

 My thought is that i would buy one of your Gloria Grandes for the primary site and the Cape Fear for the less attractive site. Would the Cape Fear bear early crops with Gloria Grande as a pollinator? Would the Gloria Grande pollination be affected by Cape Fear's alternating year pattern?
	
 Thanks for your thoughts,

You can plant bergamot seeds outdoors in early spring while the soil is cool and there is still a chance of a light frost. Cover the seeds with a light dusting of soil. When the seedlings have two sets of true leaves, thin them to 18 to 24 inches apart. If you prefer to start the plants indoors, start them eight to 10 weeks before you plan to transplant them outside.

Woo Hoo! Wynn's Winners! The paw paws of choice for Chatham County will be available for you to taste all weekend, September 13-14. Hillary and Kyle have been invited out to our good friend, Wynn Dinnsen's paw paw orchard, Full of Life Farms, that week to harvest! Here's what they will be bringing back for you...
Paw Paw fruit to taste in store - yummy and free!
Paw Paw fruit for purchase - $5 per pound
Paw Paw tublings (1 year trees) - $15 each
For those of you who do not know the scoop, Wynn created his paw paw orchard several years ago and spent years thereafter meticulously analyzing the fruits of his labor by keeping records on pulp/seed ratio, fruit size, productivity, etc. for each of his numbered trees. He grows his tublings from his best performing trees. 

More food for thought... if you buy the fruit to take home, you are not only getting delicious paw paws to eat, but you are taking home seeds inside with Wynn's choice genetics for the potential of you growing your own!",,,,,

20190530-Observe,2019-05-30,"""Liriodendron tulipifera (OSB, 33)""",,,Observe,"sent to extension https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/ask-an-expert/ https://ask.extension.org/view/1ff0a3907be02598e0f165d0345c09fe as gcc@
We cleared and graded underneath a Liriodendron tulipifera close to our house last June. We are on a slight north facing slope and added a berm uphill/north of the tree (about a foot separation from the trunk) and another berm south of the trunk about ten feet (and seemingly beyond its canopy on that side where it had been blocked by another tree removed four to six years ago).

I noticed what might be cankers on the lower trunk in early May, about seven similar to attached photo all in the lower five feet of the trunk.

The tulip poplar of concern and other nearby tulip trees are dropping leaves, presumably from the dryness -- acerbated  by the clearing last year? The fescue planted in September still seems lush without any irrigation. We've had 2.03"" rain this month (https://www.cocorahs.org station number NC-CH-41). However, some of these leaves have strange rice shaped and sized markings, that seem more likely to be an infestation of some sort?

Have i hurt our tree fatally? We have a good number of mature and majestic tulip poplars that  we are fond of so if this is not due to root damage (didn't realize their roots were so shallow) but is infectious i'm concerned about it spreading.

Thanks for your time,
