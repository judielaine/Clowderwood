## 20240830 Fence damage and repair

20240830

Big pine snag at edge of meadow came down with a huge thud during the thunderstorm that also took out our power from 3:30 pm to 1 am.

It crushed the NW corner of the orchard fence.

In order to be able to let the pets out, we spent Saturday clearing a space and then building a temporary fence. While I had some fencing and a 8’ t-post, we still needed more fencing: another 50’ of rabbit fence and 100’ o}f wildlife netting (much cheaper than the deer fencing. Very much netting.)

Will not do business with again. Scott was a problem for us. Holding back final payment was critical in getting resolution.

> May 30, 2024: Same thing took place almost word for word as the other person stated, I contracted with him but soon it apeared he had subbed the work out to someone else (Scott) .... work was not done in a correct manner/soon one said this and one said that ... ?? Who is Scott?? Then blaming me for the problems. Work was done in 2018 and the materials are not holding up/nor the hardware used on the gates.
