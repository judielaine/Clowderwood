When we had goats out in 2016 to start clearing the drain field, they also worked some on this thicket. I realized then that i wanted to clear it for an orchard area. It's not the best place for an orchard, because the tall pines are directly to the south and thus shade the area in the spring and fall, but it's what we have. Carrie and Edward and Luigi all want more room to roam, as well. So, we spent this past fall into the early summer cutting trees and shrubs and vines down, and rescuing the native ferns and sedges that lived in the thicket. "Artisanal clearing," we called it. Two weeks ago, we hired some local folks to pull out all the stumps and grade the area. Soon we will have folks come out to put a fence around the area to keep deer out and keep the cats and dog in. I've chestnut trees i've started from seed to plant, apples that grow well in the south to plant in November, and a long wish list of trees and flowers and berries with which to fill the area. I'm hoping that once i establish plants in the protected area, i can propagate them to grow in the woods.</div><div><br/></div><div>Earliest panorama 20171126 (standing to the right)<img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20171126_101608.jpg" height="1712" width="10928"/><br/></div><div><a href="evernote:///view/757910/s6/24f59439-c96b-41c7-879d-b26b52f08ab0/24f59439-c96b-41c7-879d-b26b52f08ab0/" style="color: rgb(105, 170, 53);">Before &amp; After Orchard: 201806 to …</a> (or <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAYk9ZQ5yWtBx4edsmtS8Iqw242CQeEYNuo">here</a>)</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180516_093658.jpg" height="1600" width="10096"/><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180516_093636.jpg" height="1712" width="10037"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180516_093615.jpg" height="1712" width="9974"/>20180331</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180331_162114.jpg" height="1616" width="9825"/><br/></div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180331_162128.jpg" height="1616" width="9618"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>20180312</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180312_182323.jpg" height="1696" width="9876"/>20180227</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180227_115421.jpg" height="1712" width="10122"/><br/></div><div>20180208</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180208_174026.jpg" height="1664" width="10099"/>20180121 (standing to the left)</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180121_122108.jpg" height="1584" width="10071"/><br/></div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20180121_122124.jpg" height="1584" width="10146"/><br/></div><div>20171126 (same as top)</div><div><img src="Before%20&amp;%20After%20Orchard%3A%20before%20the%20grading.html.resources/20171126_101608.jpg" height="1712" width="10928"/><br/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div></body></html>
