I have a garden fence, less than 150' in perimeter. It is fenced with t-posts and half with reasonably well installed deer mesh. I have purchased supplies to improve the fence but don't have time to install, nor do i have a T-post driver.  

One corner needs to be braced with a wedge lock corner including the installation of the bracing t-posts. A t-post driver would help. You might need to remove the mesh.

I have metal fencing to be strung at the base. While i don't expect to bury it, i do expect to make good ground contact. I don't expect high tension. I know it's possible that critters will dig: I'll deal with when i have to.

Deer mesh also needs to be installed around half the perimeter (or around the whole perimeter if removed. A Yard Link gate is the finishing element.

Would you be able to install fencing like this for me? My landline is 919-542-6112, mobile number his 215-681-4862, and email is gcc@grey-cat.com . We live off Russell Chapel Church Rd.
