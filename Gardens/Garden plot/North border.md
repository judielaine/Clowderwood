# North border

## 2021

### Corner and west

Corner currently hosting ferns and very vital white hellebore where the sunchokes have been. Don't know that i got all the sunchokes out. Have the one thicket bean i hope will return. Found a radicchio had survived. Maybe they will take off this spring. Patch of sochan and presumably a large sochan seed load.

### East and center

The combination of onion, glad, and stiltgrass was hard to maintain in 2020. With onions growing well in deer-zones and plently of glads in the orchard, maintaining the section as 

Began a slow hugelkultur build process  with logs from the glade (replaced with sweetgum logs) in 2021-01. On 2021-03-06 dug most of the section out to over a foot (two feet?) deep. Hit the saprolite layer and scooped out a good bit of that, too.

What to grow on the north side of the berm:

* Transplant the existing two socahn
* "Not your grandma's greens patch" mix [based on this list ](https://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/shade-tolerant-vegetables-zm0z11zsto) that has the hours of sun needed.
* Additional corriander & dill per [herbs that grow in shade](https://savvygardening.com/herbs-that-grow-in-shade/)

* Ostrich fern: spreads quickly, but needs moisture. The _Elephantopus carolinianus_ points to a dry quality, even though this is the low area. Also Ostrich fern is deer resistant. Still thinking about a patch between the crepe myrtles to the east of the rain garden. Currently have rotted wood and cat litter there.
  * [$8 bare root Prairie Moon](https://www.prairiemoon.com/matteuccia-struthiopteris-ostrich-fern-prairie-moon-nursery.html)
* Scallions are mentioned but walking onions generally call for full shade. Might plunk some of the sets i have down, though.
* _Hydrophyllum virginianum_ Virgina waterleaf - could be transplanted from orchard south berm at a later date.
* I think ramps are more spring ephemeral (early spring sun) than north-side of bank.
* _Galium odoratum_ Sweet woodruff is a non-native sweet scented (vanilla) groundcover.

## 201X-2021

East end planted with what i hoped would be perennial vegetables: cutting celery, chicories, jewels of opar. Little success, it was generally neglected. Did have success with wild _Elephantopus carolinianus_.

Middle section planted with gladiolus and walking onion. By 2020 also growing a thick thatch of stilt grass. 

West section planted with a variety of things including socahn, sunchokes, a thicket bean
