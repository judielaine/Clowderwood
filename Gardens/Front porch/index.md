Considering additional plants, wrote Plant Delights: The Acanthus, depending on the cultivar can be as large as 3 ft. wide at maturity and since they typically bloom in May here, they would be putting up foliage earlier in spring. This means that the Acanthus foliage might interfere with the trillium's blooms. I would allow for that when planting both the Acanthus and Trillium.

## History

### Original planting

2020-08-11 cut back the _Rhododendron spp._ (azaleas) as they are highly flammable and  develeped an infection. The absence of shrubbery does not look “naked” — I don’t think we need the _Dirca palustris_ (Leatherwood) or a witch hazel to anchor the corner.
