# King trellis

A creative reuse project for an old pair of king size bed boxsprings.

## Dimensions and analysis

- King box springs
  - each  39” x 80”
  - joint width 6'6"
- The north end of the trellis will be propped at an angle to make the sun perpendicular on the equinoxes, 35.8°. That will require the north end to be 3' 10.8” above the south end.  
- Slope of the plot
  - 2020-12-27 measured out the location. The plot fell a full foot from the south west corner to the north east corner.
- Cross bars
  - visual shield 12" deep
- Post requirements
  - 6x6 may be more visually appealing
  - Length: 7'
    - Given the slope of the plot, the support posts will need to be approximately 5' above grade in the lowest corner.
    - The general rule of thumb when setting a post is that the depth of the post's hole needs to be one-third to one-half of the actual above-ground height of the post. [ref](https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/landscaping-and-hardscaping/how-deep-should-dig-fence-posts) 
      - for 5' this is 20" (1'8") 
- Lumber shopping list
  - 2 Severe Weather 6-in x 6-in x 8-ft #2 Pressure Treated Lumber; ~$30 each
  - 2 Severe Weather 1-in x 6-in x 12-ft D & Btr Pressure Treated Lumber; ~ $9 each
    - want to make a foot wide "shield" on the north end to look attractive. Minimal load, acts as some bracing for the two posts, may act as a minor backstop for the trellis.

### Planning the angle of the trellis

[Angle to the sun](http://mypages.iit.edu/~maslanka/SolarGeo.pdf)

* We are at Latitude 35.7661830º  =>  35.8 
* Summer solstice sun declination angle 23.5 
* Angle of the solar noon sun at equinox at clowderwood (90 - 35.8)  =  54.2
* Angle to make that 90  > 35.8
* Angle of the solar noon sun at summer solstice at clowderwood (90 - 35.8) + 23.5   =  77.7 
* Angle to make that 90  > 12.3

Want to make approximately a 25 degree angle with hypotenuse of 80” .

- RISE sin(25°) = O/80”, O = 80” * sin(25°) = 33.8” = 2ft  9.8”
- RUN: 80* cos(25 deg) = 72.5 = 6 ft 0.5 inches

3 ft isn’t really out of deer reach. If we choose the equinox angle

- RISE: Sin(35.8°)*80 = 46.8” = 3 ft 10.8” 
- RUN: 80* cos(35.8 deg) = 64.9 = 5 ft 4.9 "
