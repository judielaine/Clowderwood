# Construction plans

2021-01-24: dug post holes. West post hit the yellow clay + stone before i could get 2' deep. East post has a deeper hole. Since it's down hill the height of the post is taller. Christine chain-sawed the posts to height.

Angle to the sun (http://mypages.iit.edu/~maslanka/SolarGeo.pdf)

* We are at Latitude 35.7661830º  =>  35.8 
* Summer solstice sun declination angle 23.5 
* Angle of the solar noon sun at equinox at clowderwood (90 - 35.8)  =  54.2
* Angle to make that 90  > 35.8
* Angle of the solar noon sun at summer solstice at clowderwood (90 - 35.8) + 23.5   =  77.7 
* Angle to make that 90  > 12.3

Want to make approximately a 25 degree angle with hypotenuse of 80” .
RISE sin(25°) = O/80”, O = 80” * sin(25°) = 33.8” = 2ft  9.8”
RUN: 80* cos(25 deg) = 72.5 = 6 ft 0.5 inches
3 ft isn’t really out of deer reach

If we choose the equinox angle
RISE: Sin(35.8°)*80 = 46.8” = 3 ft 10.8” 
RUN: 80* cos(35.8 deg) = 64.9 = 5 ft 4.9 "
