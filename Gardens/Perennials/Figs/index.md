# Figs

## Chicago Hardy 

Purchased from Starks Brothers in 2018, planted 2018-10-01 in the north berm.

### 2025 February pruning

During the 2024 fruiting season there were so many branches that were too out of reach even on the high ladder, that many fruit were attracting wasps. The wasps then continued working down the tree, and i was intimidated by them. I tried bagging the not yet ripe fruit: wasps chewed through the organza bags.

Goal of this pruning was to bring bring the major branching to a height where i can reach the tops. When a branch from that point itself branches, i'll cut it bac, essentially pollarding at around 7' high.

### Early notes

20201025 actually getting a cascade of ripe fruit now, just a few even few days, no bounty, but it’s nice!

20181001 Planted on N side of N berm, exposing the log. While the roots will be on the cooler side of the berm, it’s sheltered from cool air rolling down the hill.
