# Pruning

2' from ground to first branch [^Chris Bowers].

## Apples & pears

### Leader

"The leader should be headed at approximately 24 to 30 inches above the high-
est whorl of scaffolds to promote continued branching and scaffold whorl development." [^Parker]

### Scafolding whorls

Establish whorls with 18 to 24 inches between them on a central leader. [^Parker]

"Unbranched laterals headed back by approximately one-fourth of their length to encour- age side branches and to stiffen lateral branches." [^Parker]

### Broadly 

Keep a wider crotch angle than narrow. Narrower crotch angles are weaker and lead to more vigorous growth (compete as leader, influneced by apical dominance) [cf [^Parker],[^Turnbull]].

"As the branch tips over, the apical dominance of the terminal bud weakens, and buds farther down the branch are released to form nice little side branches (laterals) and on them, teeny, tiny ¼-inch branches called spurs. These tiny spurs have fat flower buds (fruiting buds) rather than skinny leaf buds. We want the laterals and spurs." [^Turnbull]

"You can encourage some, but not all, of your side branches (laterals) to make spurs by heading (also called tipping back) to two or three buds." [^Turnbull]

"water sprouts... cut some out altogether; leave some alone (don’t cut off the tips), since they will flower and fruit and be pulled over and produce more spurs later; head back some water sprouts to thicken them up into second-story branches. Try to head-back to another upright side branch and not to a horizontal branch that would water-sprout back madly..." [^Turnbull]

"Apples, pears: shorten major scaffold branches with heading, especially young ones, so that they won’t swing in the wind and lose fruit... [so] these branches ... get fatter or stouter... to hold up heavy fruit." [^Turnbull]

## Black cherry *Prunus serotina* 

Prunus serotina can be pruned and kept at shrub size by cutting them to the ground every 2-3 years. [^NCSU Plants]


## Cherries, European Plums

"Don't prune much at all.... Do not try to make your cherry tree small again by topping it. It won’t work.... That’s why that big bucket truck with the 70-foot extension is called a 'cherry picker.'" [^Turnbull]

## Peaches, Japanese Plums

Fruit on new wood; head to force new growth.[^Turnbull]

## Other tips


### How to force a branch from a bud (Generic?)

* Bench cut: "removes vigorous, upright branches back to side branches that are similar in diameter to the branch being pruned but are less upright and outward growing." [^Parker]
  * "[Use] to open up the center of the tree and spread the branches outward. This is a major cut and should be used only when necessary." [^Parker]
* Dutch cut: "...a technique used to cut lateral branches to an angled stub, allowing latent buds at the bottom to grow. (Note wide crotch angle [in the resulting sprout].)" [^Parker]
* Heading cut: " heading cut removes only the terminal portion of a branch. This type of cut promotes the growth of lower buds with the greatest vigor just below the cut." [^Parker]
  * One year old wood: " invigorated. The headed branch is much stronger and rigid, resulting in lateral secondary branching for approximately 12 to 15 inches." [^Parker]
  * Older wood: devigorating [^Parker] -- not clear exactly what's going on with this....
* Thinning cut: "t...removes an entire branch back to a side shoot branch. Thinning cuts do not invigorate the tree near the cut in comparison to some of the other pruning cuts." [^Parker]

"Find a bud and use a knife to make a nick a millimeter above and below it. Then cut the notch between the nicks completely out, making sure to cut through the bark and the green layer beneath it. That will force the tree to grow a new branch on the spot." [^DIY Apple]

Other sources[^Turnbull] describe using apical dominance as a driver, nicking above the bud to create the impression for the bud that it is on top, or nicking below the bud to discourage growth.
