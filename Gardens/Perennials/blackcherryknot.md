    https://www.rwhendricksenco.com/native-black-cherry-tree/ : Black Knot: Black knot is a serious fungal disease that can cause damage to the branches, twigs, and fruit spurs of the black cherry tree. The infected areas of the tree will produce excess bark and wood tissues that become swellings that are light brown in color.  These swellings, or galls, will continue to grow in size and eventually rupture and release its spores which will only spread the disease.  As the gall enlarges, it kills the affected twigs and branches.  Smaller twigs may die within a year while larger branches can last for several years before the disease eventually kills them.  The tree will slowly weaken and die if the disease is not treated.  Effective maintenance and pruning can help prevent black knot.
