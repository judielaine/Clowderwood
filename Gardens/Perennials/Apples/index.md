## Choosing orchard trees

Century Farm Orchards 2018 http://www.centuryfarmorchards.com/ Apples & pears $20

* Rosaceae-Amygdaloideae-Maleae: Malus pumila 'Aunt Rachel’  late July to early August
* Rosaceae-Amygdaloideae-Maleae: Malus pumila "Johnson Keeper”late October
* Rosaceae-Amygdaloideae-Maleae: Malus pumila "Grimes Golden”  September

PS: there is no direct correlation between ripening period and blooming periods. But, as it turns out Aunt Rachel is an early bloomer and Johnson's is middle to late. It is not always that easy to assume bloom periods though.

## 03 Malus pumila 'Aunt Rachel'

The "nearest" tree, purchased via [20180606 Century Farms Apple Order](20180606CenturyFarmsAppleOrder.pdf), planted on the left side of the avenue, facing the twins (multistem tulip poplar),  in orchard fall of 2018.

## 04 Malus pumila "Johnson Keeper"

The "middle" tree, purchased via [20180606 Century Farms Apple Order](20180606CenturyFarmsAppleOrder.pdf),  planted on the right side of the avenue, facing the twins (multistem tulip poplar),
 in orchard fall of 2018.

## 05 Malus pumila "Grimes Golden"

The south-west tree, purchased via [20180606 Century Farms Apple Order](20180606CenturyFarmsAppleOrder.pdf), planted closest to the southern fenceline in orchard fall of 2018. The most shaded selection chosen as this tree is primarily selected as a polinator. Thus, less concern regarding ensuring fruit production.

Recommended by Century Farms as polinator in email 8/21/16: "There would be some cross pollination between the two [Johnson Keeper & Aunt Rachel], but probably not as much as I would like for you to have. For this reason, you probably would be able to utilize a Grimes Golden. It has excellent fruit, is a good pollinator and blooms over a long period of time."
