Gaura biennis > Oenothera gaura - septic
This plant is adaptable to various well-drained dry to moist soils and prefers full sun. It is best used in naturalized areas and pollinator/native gardens. It can be slightly weedy. Flower stems sway beautifully in the breeze and bloom June through October. They are a great pollinator magnet.

Gaura longiflora, Large-flowered gaura, 4 Inch Pot, Origin Code 3

Large-flowered Gaura is practically identical to the closely related Biennial Gaura; the only distinguishing feature is that Large-flowered Gaura has curled hairs lying against the stem instead of hairs that stick out on the stem, as on Biennial Gaura. The weedy look of Gaura may deter some folks but this plant is a great option in prairie plantings because of its ability to establish itself quickly and provide late season blooms. The native range is focused largely in the South and Great Plains, but you can find Large-flowered Gaura in the upper Midwest as well.

Also known as Oenothera filiformis and Longflower Beeblossom. Large-flowered Gaura is short-lived.
