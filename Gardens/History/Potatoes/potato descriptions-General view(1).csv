Potassium are recommended; add Nitrogen in the spring. You may cover crop your beds or leave them fallow.
Potatoes DO NOT like to be next to actively decomposing green matter or to be sitting in a puddle of water. Leave
time between tillage and planting to allow green matter to break down. Build beds high enough to provide adequate
drainage. This can be done the previous fall or allow 2-6 weeks to prepare your soil before you plant.",36,12,65,transplant,transplant,transplant
