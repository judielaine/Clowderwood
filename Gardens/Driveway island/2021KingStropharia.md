# King Stopheria colony in woodchips

Stropharia or Red Wine Cap Mushrooms (Stropharia rugoso-annulata)

Ordered

* $38.54 USD to Asheville Fungi
* King Stropharia: AM4 (Aloha) - Grain Spawn - 2nd Generation (Grain Spawn) 2.75 pound bags

Distributed under woodchips, with some starch packing peanuts and shredded paper on Sunday 21 March 2021 at back of driveway circle garden. There had been lots of pine needle mulch and there was evidence of previous mycelium development. I pulled away the older mulch and mycelium, put down the starch peanuts and paper shreds, mixed in the grain spawn, and covered with new chips (sweetgum and autumn olive, predominately).

## Instructions

"Stropharia will tolerate a wide range of light conditions, but seem to grow best in part to full sun or “garden shade” where they are allowed to grow under the shade cast by plants in full sun conditions."

> It is important to properly identify Stropharia mushrooms before harvesting as there are many mushrooms that can emerge from mulched garden beds. That said, Stropharia is rather simple to identify with the following characteristics:
> * A reddish-brown cap that changes from dark to light as the mushroom matures
> * Gills that begin light black and turn darker as the mushroom matures
> * A “king crown” ring around the stem -The stem is fibrous and full of air pockets.
> * No noticible bulge where the mushroom meets the ground.
> * The only sure way to identify a mushroom is by taking a spore print. The Stropharia mushroom leaves a black-purple spore mark.
