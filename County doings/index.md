> Subject: Community Broadband Alternatives, Jan 5, Chatham Ag Center
>
> Broadband internet is no longer just for entertainment but has become a utility for everyday life and work. It is necessary to access jobs, education, telehealth, personal finances, and government services. Without access to broadband internet, a community's property values and employment suffers as much as if road access, clean water or electricity were in short supply. Chatham County has substantial areas lacking decent broadband options, and some of these are in otherwise wealthy and middle-class communities. There are multiple government agencies that are talking about helping, but there is no plan yet for many communities. 
> ...
> Fiber is the gold standard of broadband technologies. Randolph Communications is a company with multiple broadband projects in Chatham County. Another solution, Fixed Wireless Broadband, can distribute broadband in an area without installing fiber to each home.
>
> Open Broadband is a company using this technology that is ready and able to start projects in Chatham County. Join us January 5 at the Chatham Agriculture and Conference Center to hear more digital inclusion challenges in general, and about these technologies as potential solutions.
