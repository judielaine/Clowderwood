# Clowderwood's water

Clowderwood's drinking water comes from a well. In 2018 we were given a 500 gallon Norwesco Vertical Tank #22839 

In 2021 we had the well's performance tested. The [report's conclusions](Well01/20210127WellReport.pdf) indicated a full well is around 27 feet from the ground surface. The production rate of this well is near 2.7-3.0 GPM:  a “low-yield” well.

## Drinking water safety concerns

Given local concerns with the municipal water supply, we wondered if we should be concerned. Research seems to indicate the major health concern, chemicals known as PFAS, are not in the ground water, but in the river.

> "All [tests done by Duke researchers] showed some levels of PFAS, but by far the highest levels were found in Pittsboro. Tests of wells from the areas, Stapleton said, showed levels close to zero, further increasing the likelihood that the river was the source." [^Ross 2020]
