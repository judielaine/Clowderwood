Clowderwood is described to the Atlas as "other":
> Residence with about 1 acre clearing in forest

Clowderwood photos should include:

1. Panorama from deck of back, second post from porch
2. Panorama from garage corner of drainfield and walnut
3. Garden from south end, right of post
4. Garden soil (best clear soil shot; note bed)
5. Glade from NW entrance

The template caption (650 of the 1k characters):

> (1) Panorama of back yard which is at the southern edge and sw corner of the clearing, up slope on the lot,  shaded by 90â€™ pines. The area retains large tulip poplars, and is planted with fruit & nut trees and flowers, fescue, (2) drain field to left  (bounded by zig zag fence) and  general clearing under black walnut with cover crop  to right (second  zig zag) which is on the north western side of the clearing, down slope, planted with native flowers, weeds, and some fescue, (3) vegetable garden on the eastern edge of the clearing, (4) garden soil , and (5) a  mossy glade in the  south eastern corner of the clearing, up slope on the lot.

The expression of how wet or dry it is uses the 7-point scale to rate conditions from Severely Dry to Severely Wet.

1. Severely Dry: There is no soil moisture. Ponds, lakes, streams and wells may be nearly empty or dry. Producers may have crop or pasture losses. Mandatory water restrictions may be in place. 
2. Moderately Dry: Plants may be brown due to dry conditions. Streams, reservoirs or well water levels may be low. Voluntary water use restrictions may be in place. There may be water shortages. Plants, crops or pastures may be stressed. Soil is dry. 
3. Mildly Dry: Growth may have slowed for plants, crops or pastures. Soil is somewhat dry. Local plants, pastures or crops may not have fully recovered if conditions are changing from drier to wetter.
4. Near Normal: What you're seeing is what you expect for this time of year. 
5. Mildly Wet: Local plants, crops or pastures are healthy, recovering from dry conditions or draining from wet conditions. Soil moisture is above normal. 
6. Moderately Wet: Local plants, crops or pastures are healthy and lush. Soil is very damp and the ground may be saturated with water. There may be standing water in low areas and ditches. Water bodies may be fuller than normal. 
7. Severely Wet: Water levels in lakes, streams and ponds are well above normal. Standing water covers some areas that are normally dry. Soil is wet and ground is completely saturated. There may be flooding.
