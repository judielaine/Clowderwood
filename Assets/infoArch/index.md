# Information Architecture Decisions



Repository split into high level sections (directories). Each has index.md as a directory. (Should this have been index.md)



# High level sections

* Climate: for rain, temperature, etc
* Home: for the structure. 
  * Question: should the shed be included? Should the orchard fence?
* Garden
* Water: well, septic, and all the various water treatment & management.
  * should a hot water heater go here? 


## Tags?

Separate with colons or periods?
- [argues for | : and -](https://northward.io/articles/title-separator-symbols) but focus is on title tags for SEO. 
- _ used to connect words, ie  replacement for space. 
- - also used to connect words as a replacement for a space.
- Google will also interpret dashes as spaces ... [here](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/4047)
- comma to separate different tags. Unlikely to need a comma in a tag.
