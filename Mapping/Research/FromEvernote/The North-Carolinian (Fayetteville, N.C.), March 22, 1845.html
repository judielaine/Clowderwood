There is a good deal of this stone about Pedlar’s Hill, a Post Office, kept by our good democratic friend, Wm. A Rives, Esq., one of the real bone and sinew men of old Chatham. There is also found here a very excellent and useful grit, of which grindstones are made in great numbers and sold all over the country. About 3 miles North of Pedlar’s Hill is an eminence called Buckhead, which is composed almost entirely of soap stone, used by the inhabitants for hearth stones and other building purposes. Near here, on Deep River, are also large beds of coal, said to be of excelletn quality, by those who have used it. Roundtop is one of the natural curiosities of Chatham. It is about four miles from Pittsboro;; and is an eminence rising some 150 or 200 feet; it  shoots up from a perfectly level plain, and is high enough to give a splendid view of the farm houses and fields for 5 or 6 miles around. Some 20 or 30 years ago, it is said an extraordinary disease was prevalent on a small run called Landraum’s Creek, in Chatham, 5 or 6 miles from Pedlar’s Hill, which was called the creek sickness. The cattle would die in great numbers; and the persons who drank the milk of the cows, and the dogs that ate the carcase would sicken and die. Such singular fatality was so extraordinary that it drove the inhabitants entirely away from the vicinity; and even now, few or none can be induced to live on that creek. It is believed that there are now occasional cases of it in that neighborhood. How the disease originated, or what should remedy it, could never be found out. Some have supposed it to be much the same as the milk sickness so prevalent in some of the western States. We were much pleased with Chatham, and the hospitality of her citizens; but they stand in their own light by not circulating more freely the Fayetteville paper. Fayetteville being their market town, it is all-important that they should have the news from there every week. We speak for the good of the Chatham farmers as well as our own benefit.
